# Troubleshooting

## `APIError code = -1021, msg = Timestamp for this request is outside of the recvWindow.`

You need to sync the time of your device, preferably with an NTP server. Binance is super sensitive about time.

## `code=-2010, msg=Account has insufficient balance for requested action.`&#x20;

When trading on Binance, please have BNB in your wallet and then pay your fees in BNB.

## When entering my Pushover app key and user key: `pushover: invalid recipient`

You will need to install the Pushover app on at least one(1) device and have it registered.

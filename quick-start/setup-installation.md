# Setup / Installation

Nefertitiâ„¢ does not require an actual installation, all the requirements for it to work are packaged on a single binary file. It is an open-sourced project, if you would like to build from source, you can get necessary files and instructions from [Github](https://github.com/svanas/nefertiti).

* For pre-compiled binaries, please head to our [Equinox.io repository](https://dl.equinox.io/svanas/cryptotrader/stable).
* Jump to the section of your Operating System of choice for detailed instructions:
